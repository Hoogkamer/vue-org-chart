# vueOrgChart

> Organization chart:
> A complete solution to generate and publish an orgchart without the need of a webserver and database
> (c) Michael Hoogkamer

Here is the online [Demo](https://hoogkamer.github.io/vue-org-chart/)

For more information see the [Website](https://freeorgchart.netlify.app/)

**Do you want to show your (Agile) teams instead of an orgchart? Try: [Teamviewer](https://github.com/Hoogkamer/TeamViewer) open source.**

## Build Setup

This is only needed if you want to build/change your own version. If you want to use it without modification, open \doc\index.html. See also \doc\config.js. For more info see the [Website](https://freeorgchart.netlify.app/)

_The config.js, data.js and photos folder used for development are in the \static folder_

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev


# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
static output will be place in \dist folder, copy this to any location
```

Use Node 16
